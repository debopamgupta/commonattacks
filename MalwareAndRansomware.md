# Malware and Ransomware

Once installed, attackers commonly use malware to steal information, cause damage, or execute arbitrary commands on the infected system. Malware is often used to perform a set of tasks referred to as "Command and Control" (or C2/C&C). C2 malware connects back to a waiting server and allows an attacker to control the infected system remotely, often incorporating many simple tasks such as keylogging as built-in parts of the malicious software.

## Ransomware

A specialised class of malware: ransomware is used to infect as many systems as possible, encrypting the data on the devices and holding it to ransom. If the victims pay the attackers within a set timeframe (usually via a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin), the data is theoretically returned.

Ransomware usually spreads by exploiting known vulnerabilities in commonly installed software (e.g. the Microsoft Windows operating system); it can be extremely fast-spreading once an infection begins, and can demand millions in ransom money. The goal of a ransomware attack is to infect as many systems as possible, then make as much data inaccessible as possible by encrypting it with a key known only to the attacker. With the ransom paid, the malware may or may not decrypt the data and self-destruct, depending entirely on how nice the attackers are.

## Delivery methods

There are various ways that an attacker can infect a target with malware — many of these revolve around social engineering or phishing attacks. For example, an attacker may send a victim an email containing a Microsoft Word or Excel file that contains a malicious macro (code that is embedded inside the document set to run when a user opens the file).

However, there are situations in which a user may genuinely wish to execute macros, and a good attacker will capitalise on these pretexts to convince the victim to click the button.

Similarly, the attacker may send the file as a compiled `.exe`, a `PDF`, a `.ps1` PowerShell Script or `.bat` Batch script, an HTML application file (`.hta`), or even a `.js` JavaScript file to be executed by the JavaScript interpreter _built into Windows_.

_In short, there are many different ways and formats in which an attacker can send code to a victim. Once the code is executed, the infection begins._

Alternatively, the attacker may exploit a vulnerability in public-facing infrastructure in a corporate environment (for example, a webserver), thus giving themselves an opening into the internal network and allowing them to start a larger attack, facilitated by malware.

## Staying Safe

Staying safe from malware (and ransomware in particular) is best done with a combination of awareness and keeping things up to date!

- Always accept updates and patches when offered — especially in important software like operating systems. Updates often contain fixes to security flaws, so it is important to get these in place as soon as possible.
- Never click on suspicious links, especially in emails. Try not to open file attachments if possible. If a message looks suspicious, delete it, or forward it to the appropriate team if using your work account.
- Always be on the lookout for people trying to get you to download or run files — especially over email or instant messaging.
  Never plug unknown media devices (e.g. USB devices) into important computers. If you find a device in public, do not plug it into your work laptop!
- Always back up important data — this will be discussed in more detail later in the room and can be crucial in recovering from a ransomware attack.
- Make sure that your antivirus software is always up-to-date and activated.

Note: If you or your business get infected with ransomware, _**do not pay the ransom**_. Instead, call your local authorities immediately, and try to contain the infection by disabling your router or otherwise physically preventing the infected device from connecting to anything else. Do not power the infected device off, as this can sometimes destroy any potential opportunities to decrypt the data without paying.
