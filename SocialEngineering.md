Social engineering is a vast topic, encompassing any attack that relies on tricking humans into giving the attacker access, rather than attacking the technology directly. Whilst direct interaction with targets is the most common style of social engineering, other examples include dropping USB storage devices in public (e.g. in company car parks) in the hope that someone (often a company employee) will pick one up and plug it into a sensitive computer. In a similar vein, attackers may leave a "charging cable" plugged into a socket in a public place. In actuality, the cable contains malicious software such as keyloggers or tools to take control of the victim's device.

## Staying Safe from Social Engineering Attacks

In many ways, it is very tricky to stay safe from social engineering as it won't always be you who the attacker is talking to, but rather someone who can give them what they need without your consent (e.g. calling your bank whilst pretending to be you, so as to access your bank account). That said, there are still measures you can take to protect yourself from Social Engineering attacks:

- Always make sure to set up multiple forms of authentication, and ensure that providers respect these. For example, set difficult to guess — or otherwise incorrect — answers to security questions (making sure to store the answers somewhere safe!), and make sure that these questions are asked when you try to access accounts over the phone.
- Never plug external media (e.g. USBs/CDs/etc) into a computer that you care about or that is connected to any other devices. Ideally, don't plug the media in at all, and instead give it to your local police for safekeeping.
- Always insist on proof of identity when a stranger calls or messages you claiming to work for a company whose services you use. Where possible, confirm with a known phone number or email address that the call or message you received was legitimate (i.e. use a trusted method to get in contact with the company to confirm). Remember that no legitimate employee will ever ask for your password or other information that protects your account.
