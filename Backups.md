# Backups

Backups are arguably the single most important defensive measure you can take to protect your data. No matter what happens, if you have taken appropriate steps to back your information up, you will always be able to recover almost regardless of the severity of the damage.

Whether the data in question is all-important business-critical data at work or the family photos at home, backups are a simple insurance measure that pays for itself many times over should the worst come to pass.

Depending on the data in question, taking and restoring from backups could be as simple as dragging and dropping folders into Google Drive. That said, there are also many software solutions available to help automate backups and take the pain out of restoration.

### Golden 3,2,1 Rule

The golden standard for taking backups is relatively simple and is often called the "3,2,1 rule".

The 3,2,1 rule specifies that:

You should always keep at least three up-to-date copies of your data; this can include the original copy, but all copies must be maintained.

Backups should be stored on at least two different storage mediums; for example: a cloud backup and a USB device. This can include a hard drive on your PC.

One (or more) backups should be stored "off-site". Cloud services such as Google Drive are ideal for personal use in this regard.

Your backups should be safe if all three conditions of the 3,2,1 rule have been met; but of equal importance is the frequency at which you take backups. There's no point in keeping your backups stored securely if they are all a year old!

How frequently you backup your data is up to you and usually depends on the sensitivity of the data, compared to the risk of compromise and the amount of backup space available. For example, a multi-billion pound corporation handling sensitive data is at high risk of a ransomware attack and may wish to take full backups two or three times a day. By comparison, a home user may only feel the need to take backups once or twice a week.
